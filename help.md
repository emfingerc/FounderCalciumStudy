There are three conditions for calcium measurements (`8G`, `8G/QLA`, `8G/QLA/GIP`)
but no conditions for protein mRNA measurements in liver.
Conditions and trait are combined for `calcium` (such as `8G:freq_8_1`) or separate for `calcium8G`.
Distinct mice were assayed for `calcium` and `protein` (4 for `strain` and `sex`).

- `calcium`: calcium traces & spectral density with condition
- `protein`: islet proteins, measured by LC/MS of whole islet samples from the CC founder mice
- `calcium8G`: calcium traces & spectral density by condition
