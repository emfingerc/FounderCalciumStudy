There are three secretion conditions for calcium measurements (`8G`, `8G/QLA`, `8G/QLA/GIP`), defined below.
Islet proteomic data were not collected in any secretion conditions. Distinct mice were assayed for `calcium` and 
`protein` (N= greater than or equal to 4 for each `strain` and `sex`). Individual strains can be selected on the 
main menu using the checkboxes, or all strains (default) can be viewed.

The different options in the main pull-down menu are:

- `calcium`: calcium traces & spectral density with condition
- `protein`: islet proteomic measurements
- `basal`: average calcium in 2mM glucose

For `calcium`: 
Conditions and trait are combined for `calcium` (such as `8G:freq_8_1` for the 1st frequency component in 8mM glucose)
or separated by parameter (e.g. `AD` for active duration, displayed for all of the secretion conditions). These
can be selected from the second pull-down menu. 

For `protein`: 
Proteomic data are displayed for each identified peptide. Both gene symbol and peptide identifier (PP number) are included (e.g. 
`GALNS_PP_2598` for the protein GALNS). Desired proteins can be selected simultaneously with desired calcium parameters for 
correlation analysis and paired display by selecting them in the second pull-down menu. 

For `basal`:
While some elements are currently retained from the `calcium` data display settings, the only element of experimental relevance is
the Average Calcium measurement.
